# 🎯 Phoenix Knowledge Engine - Reorganization Plan

## 📋 Current State Analysis

### **What We Have**
- ✅ Complete Django backend with three-layer AI architecture
- ✅ React frontend with modern UI
- ✅ PostgreSQL database with proper schema
- ✅ Kelly and Ken avatar system
- ✅ Video content generation capabilities
- ✅ Cost monitoring and budget protection
- ✅ Working API endpoints

### **What Needs Simplification**
- ⚠️ Video generation adds unnecessary complexity for MVP
- ⚠️ Complex avatar model routing system
- ⚠️ Mixed concerns in some files
- ⚠️ No cloud deployment setup
- ⚠️ Limited testing coverage

## 🎯 Reorganization Goals

### **Phase 1: Simplify & Stabilize (This Week)**
1. **Remove video generation** (temporarily)
2. **Simplify avatar system** to basic personality prompts
3. **Clean up code organization**
4. **Set up cloud deployment**
5. **Add basic monitoring**

### **Phase 2: Core Features (Next Month)**
1. **Improve content quality**
2. **Add user authentication**
3. **Implement content caching**
4. **Add comprehensive testing**

### **Phase 3: Scale & Optimize (Next Quarter)**
1. **Add video generation back**
2. **Implement advanced features**
3. **Add analytics and reporting**
4. **Plan for vendorless AI**

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

### **Step 1: Create New Structure**
- Create new directory structure
- Move files to appropriate locations
- Update imports and references

### **Step 2: Simplify Avatar System**
- Remove complex model routing
- Use single model with different prompts
- Keep personality differences

### **Step 3: Remove Video Generation**
- Comment out video-related code
- Keep audio generation for future
- Focus on text content

### **Step 4: Clean Up Code**
- Remove unused imports
- Fix hardcoded values
- Improve error handling

### **Step 5: Set Up Cloud Deployment**
